"""
Functional Core (FC) - Pure business logic.

This module contains pure functions with no I/O.
All functions must be deterministic and side-effect free.

Guidelines:
- No database access
- No network calls
- No file system operations
- No external dependencies with side effects
- All inputs/outputs must be immutable or copied
- Prefer dataclasses for complex return types
